title: Ley de demeter
---

Usamos la “ley de demeter” siempre que es posible (que es la mayoría de las veces), pueden consultarla acá \[1\] y acá \[2\], un resumen:

        * You can play with yourself.
        * You can play with your own toys (but you can't take them apart),
        * You can play with toys that were given to you.
        * And you can play with toys you've made yourself.
